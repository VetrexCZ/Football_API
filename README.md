# Football_API

I have developed a project about ``Football API`` which contains a lot of data about football matches, player stats etc.
all over the world. I used the ``requests`` package to connect to the api, and ran 3 tests using ``pytest`` and 
``@pytest.mark.parametrization`` targeting the specified api. To keep the public api key out of the project, 
I used the ``python-dotenv`` package which safely hid the api key.
